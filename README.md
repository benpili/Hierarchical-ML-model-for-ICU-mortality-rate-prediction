## Abstract
In this work, we propose a Hierarchical ML model for ICU mortality rate prediction. We believe that the ramification of certain health-conditions can aid the modelâ€™s ability to predict the mortality rate of ICU patients. Our approach is a novel take on an existing task - in-hospital mortality prediction, and one we strongly believe can alter the decision making process of ICU care and treatment trajectory. This is a proof of concept that building hierarchical models that include more conditions than just cardiac conditions might be beneficial for making better classification models.
